    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section id="about">
      <section id="me">
        <p class="mylife">
          My name is Carolina del Mar Gamez Herazo, so yes, “Del Mar” is my middle name and despite what you may think, I 
          really feel lucky for it, it is original and cute. I was born in Cartagena, my beautiful “ciudad amurallada”, land 
          of beaches, champeta, history and a lot of culture. <br>
          I studied my whole life at Colegio La Anunciación, where I learned the basics of my knowledge and I finished a 
          technician at SENA in administrative assistance just before graduating in 2020. I started medicine at Universidad 
          del Norte, but dropped out because although I really like science, part of me also liked numbers and math (yes, I'm 
          crazy like that). A semester later, I started biotechnological engineering at EIA University, where I am now in my 
          seventh semester. <br>
          These last semesters I had the opportunity to find my favorite area of the career, so at the moment I am fully involved 
          in the world of bioprocesses, including modeling, simulation and control. So, with a solid academic background, I hope to 
          push the boundaries of scientific innovation through proper use of existing techniques and methodologies. <br>
          My background includes participation in iGEM Design League, where I collaborated in the development of a solution for the 
          control of Thumbergia alata using synthetic biology. I have actively participated in multiple research groups, such as bioprocess 
          modeling, bioinformatics, genetic engineering and fermentation and applied bioprocesses. I have also taken courses in specialized 
          areas of biotechnology and engineering such as design of experiments, bioprocess modeling and industrial process simulation. <br>
          With each experience, I have strengthened my passion for biotechnology and its potential to drive meaningful change. Looking 
          ahead, I am eager to continue expanding my expertise and my knowledge, and becoming a great person and professional.

                  Winogradsky column simulates the microbes ecosystems found in fresh and seawater. This column differentiates 
                  in three characteristic habitats: aerobic zone in the surface, microaerophilic zone in the middle, and anaerobic 
                  zone in the bottom. So a winogradsky column was built in a plastic bottle and the results were studied.

                    Nitrogen is essential for plants. Rhizobium bacteria can fixate this nutrient into the roots of legumes. 
                    Taking this into account, rhizobium bacteria were isolated to formulate a biofertilizer, to improve the 
                    growth of bean plants.

                    Black-eyed Susan vine, a climbing plant from east Africa, has propagated through all America becoming an 
                    aggressive invasive species. A gene silencing strategy based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) is proposed 
                    for the control of this invasive species.

                    Books open doors to new perspectives. From scientific literature to fiction, reading sharpens my 
                    analytical skills and fuels my curiosity about the world. I could read "The little prince" one 
                    thousand times and never get bored, as well as the Harry Potter saga.

                Science meets art in the kitchen, just as science meets innovation in biotechnology. Baking has taught me 
                patience, precision, and experimentation skills that surprisingly align with those I need to perform in 
                bioprocessing.
